# MsgRoom Custom Server

A custom Windows 96 MsgRoom Server

**WARNING:**
PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS **YET**!!! A lot is different from the normal MsgRoom, so your bots will probably not work with it.

Made by [nolanwhy](https://github.com/nolanwhy) and [Kelbaz](https://github.com/kelbazz). Please don't tell us that the code is bad, we will ignore you anyways.

## Step 1: Download the package

Just click on "Code" then "Download ZIP". If you don't know how to do this, why are you here?

## Step 2: Download dependencies

Open a terminal in the folder and run `npm install`.

## Step 3: Run the package

Execute `npm run start` in your terminal.

### (Optional) Step 4: Share with friends

If you want to share with friends, we recommend using ngrok:

- Run `ngrok http 3030` in your terminal if you want to use the default port.
- Run `ngrok http (YOUR PORT HERE)` in your terminal if you have a custom port.
- You also need an ngrok account, which you can set up [here](https://ngrok.com/).

## Done!

You have successfully installed MsgRoom Custom Server! The terminal will display the URL to visit your custom server.

**Thank you for using our custom server!**

## How to add bots

*Note: this is temporary, a special MRCSAPI will release soon.*

The bot owner needs to make some adjustments, but here's how: \
Go to the source code of the library you want to use, then try finding `io()` or `socket()`. \
When you found it, it should be like `io(URL)`. \
Change it to: `io("http://yourURL.real:port", { transports: ['websocket'] })` \
If the port is 80, don't put `:port`, if you have https, put https, its easy.

**Congrats! ðŸŽ‰** You successfully made your lib work with MRCS.

## How to give yourself staff and perform mod actions

1. Go to .env and edit the ADMIN_SECRET value
2. Go to /admin and put the admin secret
3. Follow instructions

### Alternative

1. Go to `database/admins.json` and add your ID.
2. You can execute `/a help` to get a list of every admin command.
3. To ban a user, use `/a ban` or add the user's ID to `database/banned.json`.
4. To kick a user, use `/a disconnect`.
(Note: **THIS WILL BE CHANGED SOON TO SOMETHING ELSE**)
