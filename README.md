You can edit .env to your liking.
### (Optional) Step 5: Share with friends
If you want to share with friends, we recommend using ngrok:
- Run `ngrok http 3030` in your terminal if you want to use the default port.
- Run `ngrok http (YOUR PORT HERE)` in your terminal if you have a custom port.
- You also need an ngrok account, which you can set up [here](https://ngrok.com/).

## How to add bots
This is up to the bot api owner to add, but if its like msgroom-orm, here's how to do it \
Your client should look like ```const client = new Client("TestBot", "!");``` \
Now, it's really easy, just add a new argument to Client with an object containing the arguments \
If you don't understand anything, just do it like this: ```const client = new Client("TestBot", "!", {server: "wss://yourURL.com:port"});``` (If you don't have a port, don't put one) \
**Congrats! ðŸŽ‰** Your bot should now work with MRCS!
