## How to add bots
*Note: this is temporary, a special MRCSAPI will release soon.*
The bot owner needs to make some adjustments, but here's how: \
Go to the source code of the library you want to use, then try finding `io()` or `socket()`. \
When you found it, it should be like `io(URL)`. \
Change it to: `io("http://yourURL.real:port", { transports: ['websocket'] })` \
If the port is 80, don't put `:port`, if you have https, put https, its easy.
**Congrats! ðŸŽ‰** You successfully made your lib work with MRCS.
